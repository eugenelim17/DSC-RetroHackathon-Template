# Retro Hackathon - HAND SANITISER SHOOTER

This is a Python game for the [DSC Retro Game Hackathon] (https://github.com/Developer-Student-Club-UoA/RetroGameHackathon).

We have used the examples from https://github.com/kitao/pyxel.git as our template. And we have modified the sprite, enemies, added mask and potion as well as the background, background music and sound effect. Please read the 'How to play' instruction for more information.

## Dependencies and main file

This game only relies on pyxel to be installed. Our main file is named as 'main.py'. 
You could run the game by:
