# Retro Hackathon

This is a Python template for the [DSC Retro Game Hackathon](https://github.com/Developer-Student-Club-UoA/RetroGameHackathon).

We have used the example from https://github.com/kitao/pyxel.git as our template. We updated the game into a Corona Virus shooting game. We have added Potion and Mask, edited the sprite and enemies. We have also modified the background and background music/sound effect. For more information, you may read our 'How to play' instruction.
