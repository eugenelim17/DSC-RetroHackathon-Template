# Retro Hackathon - HAND SANITISER SHOOTER

This is a Python game for the [DSC Retro Game Hackathon] (https://github.com/Developer-Student-Club-UoA/RetroGameHackathon).

We have used the examples from https://github.com/kitao/pyxel.git as our template. And we have modified the sprite, enemies, added mask and potion as well as the background, background music and sound effect. Please read the 'How to play' instruction for more information.

## Dependencies and main file

This game only relies on pyxel to be installed. Our main file is named as 'main.py'. 
You could run the game by: 
- install pyxel 
- run main.py

## How to play

The quest of this game is basically to move right or left, up or down to destroy and to avoid the 
universal enemy which is the coronavirus. If you get infected, your HP will be decreased by 20%. 
Also look out for the dropped items for they are useful in the game.
- Meds: increases your HP by 20%.
- Face Mask: provides shield for a period of time and earns you 30 points. This item is more 
difficult to collect compared to meds, but the more you collected it, the closer you are to victory.
Every time you score 100 points, your level will be increased by one. 

*To win this game, you need to finish level 9.*
